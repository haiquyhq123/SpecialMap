# About This project

This is a project for a local hackathon called ConHacks2025 that tries to solve one of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, Primarilly focusing on SDG 16.


## Issues During Development
had to change gears about 12 hours in to the project upon realising that it was minimally focusing on the project theme. 

Thankfully, due to quick thinking and an innovative mindset, the issue of not following the theme was solved


## What Is SpecialMap?
SpecialMap is a tool that displays road closures, current govrnment construction projects, and future govenment construction projects in the Waterloo Region on an interactive map

SpecialMap also allows users to anonymously send an incident report to the server that will then be displayed on the interactive map. Guaranteeing that any incident report made by users is truly anonymous 

## Why Use SpecialMap?
SpecialMap is a one stop shop for you to see what trafic may be like in an area as well as what areas may be more safe than others.

The anonymous incident report is a **key function** of SpecialMap that allows for anyone to feel safe speaking about incidents, crimes, or corrupt officials without potentially exposing themselves to **danger!**

> Look out for Your own safety with this convenient SpecialMap!
